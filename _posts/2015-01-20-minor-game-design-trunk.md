description: "WASD to move, mouse to move the camera and once you have legs, space to jump. 
With a controller, walk with the left stick, control the camera with the right stick and jump with A or Y.
Reaching the white square was the final goal in this prototype version."

A game where the experience was central and the spatial design stemmed from the fact that you are at all times trapped in a sphere, but that means you can see the world stretched out above you, creating an impressive experience, and you have the opportunity to jump directly to the opposite side which helped us make a puzzle game out of this.

I set up the framework for the game, movement within the sphere, implemented the jump, camera movement and collision, and tweaked the level design to work well with the jump functionality (make sure it is not possible to get stuck or jump through the world).
