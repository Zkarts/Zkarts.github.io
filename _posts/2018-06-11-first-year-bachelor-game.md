A recreation of Battle City with the addition of 360° movement and improved AI. There are three types of tanks with their own specialisations (speed, defence or attack) to choose from. You have to defend your pudding and if you fail and the pudding’s health drops, you will slowly see it get sad, cry and gradually get eaten.
I created the art and animations aside from the main menu background and the actual tanks. I worked on design, terrain and the bullet interactions.
