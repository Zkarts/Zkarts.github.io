I worked at a small startup studio, Dutch5, for a year, helping in development of BRUUT, a multiplayer mobile game that was a real-time strategy game when I joined the company, but was later changed to a turn-based system.

### Bridge to the Art Department
In the early days, I saw a gap in communication between departments and jumped in to help bridge this gap. I became the bridge between the departments and helped to more smoothly import art and adapt systems to the art assets that were delivered.
I also worked closely with one of our designers at the time to improve their experience with the map editor tool that had been created for them. I intentionally look into what goes into these disciplines as a hobby to also be more capable of communicating and collaborating with them and enjoyed these roles a lot.

### Mobile Development in Unity
BRUUT was developed using the Unity Engine and I quite enjoyed the mind-set at Dutch5 to not be scared or intimidated, but instead excited about the newest packages and features, which led to the exploration and usage of these newest systems.

Since BRUUT is a mobile game, I encountered and largely handled both the iOS and Android build pipelines myself. I had to dive into various systems to decrease filesize to match store requirements and finally handled the submissions and store pages and releases, from early access systems to full releases.

I had to deal with the Apple App Store review system, build settings in Unity which included server settings for our servers, and building separated installation packes for Android (OBB files). We later switched to Asset Bundles through the new Addressables package in Unity, which we would then host on our servers to decrease initial app size and allow for an updating system.

I played a big part in setting up our connection to Google's Firebase to facilitate our authentication and login systems, dealing with asynchronous loading issues, bugs in the plugin itself and varying functionality per platform.

### Exploring Mobile and Unity Optimisations
BRUUT was marketed with its high quality art, which I still agree with. However, we needed to optimise performance to make this work nicely on most devices. This included Unity optimisations like nested canvases and no longer using animators for UI, to GPU profiling and debugging through dedicated tools. One of the bigger gains was not in any of these systems, but in clever usage of textures and UV space, which I learned a great deal about from our artists, which led to smaller, but denser textures overall.

### Game Design, Guiding Interns and Organisation
Since we had a relatively small team, I eventually took on a designer role as well, utilising my minor in Game Design. Together with another designer, we managed to straighten out issues in the monetisation model to make it more viable by referencing succesful, existing mobile games. We had to adjust most systems and gameplay to align with this new, more feasible model. This redesign included UX design to match the intended behaviour and I later created many of these UI elements and screens myself.

I quickly turned into a relatively senior employee thanks to the small size of the team. This led me to a position wherein I got to guide two development interns for half a year, who both enjoyed their time with us, each learned a lot in the process and were able to provide their fair share of help in development.

The position I grew to also allowed me to take part in the planning and organisation aspects within the company, helping in overseeing the git repository and keeping HacknPlan, our SCRUM system of choice, up-to-date.
