Throughout the application procedures for different functions, I ran into the SOLID principles and was intrigued by the ideas and how to apply them. I worked on a fairly simple Whac-A-Mole game and focused on applying the SOLID principles to keep everything extendable, testable and loosely coupled.

I was very happy with how the extensibility turned out. Particularly, aspects like integration in Unity, how easy it was to manage the mole variations and make new ones and how loosely different components were set up. I thought a lot about implementation of UI elements and how to tie everything together, while keeping the connections loose and think I ultimately succeeded in what I set out to do.

I was also surprised to see how easy it is to work with a system that is set up in such a way. It is more work initially, creating all the classes, files and setting everything up to adhere to the same structure and framework, but it is far clearer and much more straightforward what the next step should be, where a bug is if there is one, and how to best implement a new feature or extension.
