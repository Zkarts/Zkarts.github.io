We were tasked to design and develop a game for the national GP union to help GP's run their practice, since they are taught how to treat people, but are often unprepared for the management of a practice.
We decided on a Theme Hospital-inspired simulation game, which would randomly trigger certain events with issues provided by our client dealing with several aspects of management. When the practice would be running well, the player would receive positive feedback and see their patients' satisfaction.

I acted as a SCRUM Master in this project, guiding all parties in collaborating correctly and aligning ideas. I also developed the building system used to design the practice by placing rooms and items. I worked closely with our artists to develop and implement assets, such as characters and the placeable rooms and objects.
