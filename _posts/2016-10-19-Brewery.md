In a collaboration project with the HKU School of Arts, we were tasked to design and develop a game for a client. In our case, the client was a beer brewery set up in an old fort, who wanted to combine the best of both worlds to show off the fort and their brewery.

We ultimately decided to make a management game in which the player receives requests from customers and has to use the rooms of the fort for the different steps in the beer-brewing process, first picking the desired flavour by mixing and matching ingredients and then walking through the brewing process through mini-games.

I set up the framework for the game, touch controls, camera movement, developed the requests system, worked on the UI, implemented several mini-games and built a building construction system.
