An assignment for my Master's Advanced Graphics course was to implement the basic Whitted-style ray tracer and a path tracer, fully in C++, with several features and options. These two ray tracers needed to be compared and a report was to show the differences.

I developed the entire Whitted-style ray tracer and path tracer, with basic shapes, materials, OBJ/FBX file import, depth of field and several features to speed up the convergence and noise reduction, such as Importance Sampling and a Russian Roulette solution to the Monte Carlo system.
