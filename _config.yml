description: Welcome to my portfolio website. I'm a software engineer in the games industry.<br>I love games as a medium and everything involved in making them. Games themselves, learning anything I can and improving my skills in game development are my biggest hobbies. I love collaborating with different disciplines and, as a programmer, getting to tie all the aspects together into a cohesive product and allowing each aspect to shine as the best they can be.
